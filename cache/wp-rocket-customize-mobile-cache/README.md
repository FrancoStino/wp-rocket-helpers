# WP Rocket | Customize Mobile Cache options

Disables **Separate Cache files for Mobile devices** by default and also **Optimize Critical Images**, as separate cache for mobile devices is a requirement by that optimization.

‚ö†Ô∏è You can also disable the **Mobile Cache** option. 
Keep in mind that doing this will prevent mobile devices from receiving cached and optimized pages. 

üìù To Disable **Mobile Cache** please uncomment line 35, change it from:

    // $options['cache_mobile'] = 0;
    
to

    $options['cache_mobile'] = 0;

**To reverse the changes,** simply deactivate the this helper plugin.
