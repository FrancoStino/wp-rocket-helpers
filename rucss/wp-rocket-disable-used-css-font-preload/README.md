# WP Rocket | Disable Used CSS Fonts Preload

Disables the preloading of fonts (doc: [Using Remove Unused CSS with Preload Fonts](https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/1529-remove-unused-css#preload-fonts)) that are found in the used CSS when the **Remove Unused CSS** feature is used.

On plugin activation/deactivation:
* the used CSS is cleared
* the cache is cleared
* preload is initiated if the respective option is activated
