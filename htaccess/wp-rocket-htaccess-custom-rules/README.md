# WP Rocket | Add custom htaccess rules

Add custom rules to the .htaccess file.

**ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION, HANDLE WITH CARE!**

_Only install this plugin yourself if you are comfortable with editing files via (S)FTP! This plugin itself works perfectly well; however, in case something should conflict in your custom environment, you might have remove this plugin manually via (S)FTP and edit .htaccess directly._

_Please comment out 41st/42nd and 72nd/73rd lines in the code dependently on where do you want to place your .htaccess rules._
